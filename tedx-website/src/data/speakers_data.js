            Michael Huang is a third culture kid with an obsessive curiosity for all things storytelling, culture, and community. 
            He has 15+ years of experience in the creative, arts, and advertising industries. As a Seattle native having grown up 
            in the local Hip Hop scene, he's traveled the world competing in international breakdancing competitions, managed 
            musicians, and shot photos and documentaries. He translated these experiences into his early work in social media during 
            its initial rise and later at award winning global agencies such as Razorfish and McGarryBowen. After a stint on Madison 
            Avenue in New York, he went on to found his own creative agency, Milli, in 2014 focused on creative, culture, and social 
            change. Since then Milli has gone on to win numerous awards working with clients ranging from Microsoft and Netflix to 
            Community Passageways and The Movement For Black Lives. These experiences have informed his perspective on how we can 
            reconcile the inherent dilemma of living in a hyper-capitalistic society while also working towards a more equitable, 
            just, and sustainable future.
